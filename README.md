PROJECT DESCRIPTION

ATM Simulation System using C

The ATM Simulation System is a simple menu-driven console application developed using the C programming language. This project is designed for beginners to understand basic programming concepts such as functions, loops, conditional statements, and switch-case control structures.
The program simulates the basic operations of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). It allows the user to interact with the system by choosing options from a menu to check account balance, deposit money, withdraw money, or exit the application.

OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT

To understand menu-driven programming
To implement functions for modular coding
To learn decision-making using switch-case
To practice loops for repeated execution
To simulate real-world ATM operations

FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM

Check current account balance
Deposit money into the account
Withdraw money with balance validation
Continuous execution until the user exits

TECHNOLOGIES USED

Programming Language: C
Platform: Console / Terminal
Compiler: GCC / Turbo C
